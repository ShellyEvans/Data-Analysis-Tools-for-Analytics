Human Resources Analysis 
Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition within the provided data set by looking at the following categories:  Age, Attrition, Business Travel, Daily Rates, Department, Distance From Home, Educations, Education Field, Employee Count, Employee Number, Environment Satisfaction, Gender, Hourly Rate, Job Involvement, Job Level, Job Role, Job Satisfaction, marital Status, Monthly Income, Monthly Rate, Number of Companies Worked, Over 18, Overtime, Percent Salary Hike, Performance Rating, Relationship Satisfaction, Standard Hours, Stock Option Level, Total Working Years, Training Times Last Year, Work Life Balance, Years at Company, Years in Current Role, Years Since Last Promotion, and Years with Current Manager. 
Addition comparisons were done with the following categories: 
Attrition vs. Non-attrition vs. Monthly Income
It was found that attrition levels were not closely correlated with monthly income levels. While under $1000.00 per month employees did have a higher rate of attrition this was not observed in the income brackets above that. People with a monthly income at 11,000.00 and above showed very low levels of attrition but it is possible that people with that monthly income level are more senior in there positons and are long term employees and therefore less likely to being willing or able to find another comparable job.
